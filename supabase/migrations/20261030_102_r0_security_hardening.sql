-- R0 security hardening (pre-production audit findings F-04, F-11).
--
-- 1. audit_logs integrity. The table had a public INSERT policy (user_id = auth.uid()), so any
--    signed-in user could write arbitrary audit rows, and anon/authenticated held UPDATE, DELETE
--    and TRUNCATE grants. Audit rows are now written only by trusted server code (service_role)
--    and are append-only: users keep SELECT on their own rows, nobody can edit or remove a row.
-- 2. Trigger functions on_job_state_transition and sync_profile_email were executable by anon
--    and authenticated through the default PUBLIC grant. Triggers fire without an EXECUTE grant,
--    so the grant is revoked, and sync_profile_email now pins its search_path.
